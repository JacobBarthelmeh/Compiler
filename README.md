# Compiler

To run the compiler compile the code and use compiler/Compiler as the entry point. If no arguments are passed in than the compiler looks for all files in its current directory with the ending of .mp.
Options for arguments when running are
```
    -h (shows help)
    -c inputFile.mp
    -o outputFile.mm
    -d (turn on debug mode)
```
