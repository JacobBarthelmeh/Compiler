	<H3 CLASS="western">Regular Language Scanner</H3>
	<P>This could have easily been done using RegEx, which is a standard
	library built in to almost every programming language with string
	operations. The number of lines making the scanner (and the number
	of hours) could have been a fraction of what it is. However, Java's
	switch statement is an assembly-level HashMap that runs in 1
	Bytecode (1 instruction/cycle in Java's virtual machine). So, many
	ugly lines of code were made but which run faster than RegEx (O(1)
	in 1 bytecode versus O(n!)). This modularized the scanner so cleanly
	that the same design was used for the parser as well. 
	</P>
	<H3 CLASS="western">Symbol Table Design</H3>
	<P>The Symbol Tables are handled by a Symbol Table Handler. The
	Symbol Table Handler guarantees that the tables and entries are
	populated properly. The Parser simply provides the Handler with
	calls such as pushTable(), popTable(), newEntry(), finishEntry(),
	etc. However, the SemanticAnalyzer only ever needs to use one
	operation: getEntry(). Thus, in the Parser's perspective, the Symbol
	Table design is of a Stack, but in the Semantic Analyzer's
	perspective, the Symbol Table design is of a HashMap. This is to
	make use of both data structures' best features. Stack operations of
	inserting and deleting are O(1) while searching is O(n), but the
	Parser only inserts and deletes. HashMap operations of inserting and
	deleting can become O(n) when collision between names is possible
	(which it is, in this project), but lookup is O(1). The Semantic
	Analyzer only ever makes use the lookup feature. In reality, the
	lookup feature takes O(t) time, where t (the number of tables) is
	maximally bounded by 10 and is no greater than 2 for the average
	case, which is for all practical purposes a constant running time. 
	</P>
	<H3 CLASS="western">Semantic Analyzer Design</H3>
	<P>In the design of the semantic analyzer it is set up to have a
	module design pattern, offering up general functions to be called
	when triggered events happen in the parser. The constructor takes as
	arguments; the symbol table handler object, and the name of the file
	that the machine code is to be outputted. As the process unfolds the
	semantic analyzer pushes each line of code to that file. At the
	beginning of the program and for each function/procedure call there
	is a function to handle generating code to store the current
	register. Then at the end of each there is a corresponding function
	to restore them. At the beginning of setting up a function call the
	argument values, or address of stack location in the case of by
	reference, is pushed onto the stack. Then after branching to the
	location of machine code for the function, it knows that the most
	recent thing on the stack is those arguments. Since the only loops
	in the code is for iterating over function parameters, and there is
	no recursive calls, the theoretical run time should be bound by O(n)
	where n is lines of code being generated and there is some k, being
	a constant representing the number of function/procedure parameters
	being processed. The biggest trade off in the design is that it
	follows a naive stack only based approach. This will lead to slower
	run times of compiled code, at times taking maybe three cycles where
	the same process could be done in one. Using this stack only based
	design gives the fugacious advantage of being more simple to
	implement.<!-- InstanceEndEditable -->
